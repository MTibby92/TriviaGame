we need a start button and a restart button listening for a click event; these buttons should trigger the start game function

the game could be an object; research object constructors; it might be beneficial to create a new object each time the function is run so you don't have to worry about any funky behavior

answer choices should each be buttons so you can click anywhere; style it to not look like a button

game object needs a timer method

game object can have a question attribute/object with key:value pairs? can a key have multiple values (works as long as the values are in an array)

need a method to generate the new question page

need a method to generate the correct answer page

need a method to create the wrong answer page

need a method to generate the final results page

need a method to restart the game or create a new object of the game
